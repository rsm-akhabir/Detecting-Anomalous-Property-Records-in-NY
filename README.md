# Project Overview
This project develops a scalable unsupervised anomaly detection system to identify potentially fraudulent or misreported property records in the NYC Property Valuation and Assessment dataset. With over 1 million property records spanning diverse boroughs and valuation classes, the goal was to surface properties whose reported values appear inconsistent with physical characteristics or local market norms. Without labeled fraud data, the solution relies on engineered valuation ratios, geographic normalization, and anomaly detection algorithms to prioritize suspicious properties for further investigation by the city.

# Methods:
Two complementary unsupervised techniques were employed:

1. PCA + Minkowski Distance: Transforms records into a standardized PCA feature space, then computes Euclidean distance from the origin. Properties farther from the “norm” are considered more anomalous.

2. Autoencoder + Reconstruction Error: A shallow neural network trained to reproduce input features; high reconstruction errors indicate irregular records that diverge from typical patterns.

Final anomaly rankings were generated by combining the two scores, weighting geometric distance more heavily to balance broad and nuanced deviations.

# Data Preparation
Dataset: 1,070,994 NYC property records (2010–2011)

Cleaning & Filtering:
- Removed 26,501 public/institutional properties (e.g., city departments, cemeteries)
- Imputed key missing/invalid values (valuation, stories, dimensions) using hierarchical group means (e.g., by borough, tax class, and building class)

# Feature Engineering:

9 valuation ratios (r1–r9): Compare property value to land/building area, volume, etc. Transformed to highlight both high and low anomalies.
Group-standardized ratios: Each r-variable normalized by ZIP and tax class to flag local outliers.

Composite features:
value_ratio: Market value vs. assessed value
size_ratio: Building area vs. lot area (physically implausible if > 1.0)

# Evaluation & Results
Properties were ranked by anomaly score and investigated based on their divergence from physical norms and market values.

Top anomalies exhibited:
- Impossibly large buildings on tiny lots
- Drastically undervalued properties in high-value ZIP codes
- Extremely high valuation per cubic foot or square foot

Visual diagnostics included:
- Heatmaps
- Score distributions
- Owner and location frequency charts

Case Studies:
- Case 1: $15M property with a building 20× larger than its lot – likely data entry error or illegal construction

- Case 2: Manhattan ZIP (10007) property with FULLVAL of only $120K and assessment over $2.1M – potentially undervalued to avoid taxes

- Case 3: Outer borough property valued at $8.2M with only 4,000 ft³ volume – highly unusual valuation per cubic foot, suggesting overvaluation or zoning issues

# Financial Relevance
The project’s anomaly scoring system highlights properties with valuation inconsistencies that may result in tax revenue loss or regulatory oversight gaps. The approach is designed to:

- Guide city auditors to prioritize high-risk cases

- Integrate into existing compliance and enforcement workflows

- Adapt over time with expert review to refine detection criteria

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (Keras), Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook



Key Outcomes
- Delivered an interpretable fraud risk score for every NYC property
- Identified thousands of anomalous records with valuation inconsistencies
- Provided visual and analytical tools to support investigative workflows
